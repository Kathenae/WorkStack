## Tech Stack (Laravel, Inertia/React, MySQL)

  WorkStack is being built using the Laravel framework, a free, open-source PHP web application framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Laravel provides a set of tools and features that make it easy for developers to build robust and scalable web applications and will be a perfect fit for a project of this scale.

  The frontend is being built using Inertia.js, a framework that allows developers to build single-page apps (SPAs) using classic server-side routing and controllers, but with the feel of a SPA. The use of Inertia.js will enable the application to provide a more app-like experience for the end-users, with seamless transitions between server-rendered pages.

  The application will make use of a MySQL database to store and retrieve data, which is designed to handle a high volume of data and optimized for performance and scalability. The application will also integrate various third-party libraries and services, such as for example for the payment gateway, for the file storage, for the time tracking, etc, which will provide additional functionality and improve the user experience.
